## [21] Over-temperature Status [CH7:CH4]:
## 	0 = no over-temperature
## 	1 = over-temperature
## [20] Over-temperature Status [CH3:CH0]:
## 	0 = no over-temperature
## 	1 = over-temperature
## [19] Channels Shutdown Status:
## 	0 = shutdown is OFF
## 	1 = shutdown is ON
## [16]  TRG-IN Status: read current logical level on TRG-IN
## [15]  GPI Status: read current logical level on GPI
## [8] Board Ready: Board readiness for acquisition 
## 	0 = Board is not ready to start acquisition
## 	1 = Board is ready to start acquisition
## [7] PLL Unlock Detect: PLL unlock flag.
## 	0 = PLL has had an unlock condition since the last register read access
## 	1 = PLL hasn’t had any unlock condition since the last register read access.
## [6] PLL Bypass mode:
## 	0 = PLL is not bypassed
## 	1 = PLL is bypassed: the VCXO frequency directly drives the clock ditribution tree.
## [5] Clock source:
## 	0 = Internal (PLL uses the internal 50 MHz oscillator as a reference)
## 	1 = External (PLL uses the external clock as a reference)
## [4] EVENT FULL: it is set to 1 as the maximum nr. of events to be read is reached
## [3] EVENT READY: it is set to 1 as at least one event is available to readout
## [2] Acquisition Status: It reflects the status of the acquisition (front panel “RUN” LED).
## 	0 = Acquisition is stopped
## 	1 = Acquisition is running

## [6] Power Down:
## 		0 = No ADC channels power down
## 		1 = ADC channels in power down by automatic temperature protection
## [5] Temp Fail:
## 		0 = No error
## 		1 = A channel temperature fail occurred
## [4] PLL Lock Loss:
## 		0 = No error
## 		1 = A PLL lock loss occurred
## [3:0] Internal Communication Timeout: 0000 = No Error
